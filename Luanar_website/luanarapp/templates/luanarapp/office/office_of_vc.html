            <p class="pl-20  pr-10">If you wish to invite the Vice-Chancellor to your event you need as much notice as you can. The Vice-Chancellorâ€™s diary can be booked up to 6 months in advance provided you have a definite date and times.</p>
            <p class="pl-20  pr-10">The Vice Chancellors personal assistant (vc@luanar.ac.mw) is happy to receive enquiries about the Vice-Chancellorâ€™s likely availability if you wish to ascertain this before booking your event.</p>
            <p class="pl-20  pr-10">
              At the time of booking we need to know the level of involvement you wish from the Vice-Chancellor, eg, power point, speech, a few words, presenting awards, or just attendance. A briefing document should be completed and sent to his personal assistant a week before your event. If the Vice-Chancellor is speaking at your event you will also need to liaise with the Marketing and Communication office regarding points that you would like him to cover.  
            </p>
            <p class="pl-20  pr-10">
              The Universityâ€™s Executive Management team is collectively responsible for supporting events and it may be more appropriate for a member of the Executive Management team other than the Vice-Chancellor to attend in many circumstances.
